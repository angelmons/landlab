    "This notebook demonstrates the usage of the `RiverFlowDynamics` Landlab component to simulate a circular dam break. The component runs a semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian finite-volume approximation to the depth-averaged 2D shallow-water equations of Casulli and Cheng (1992) and related work.\n",

    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth-averaged 2D shallow-water equations are the simplification of the Navier-Stokes equations, which correspond to the balance of momentum and mass in the fluid. It is possible to simplify these equations by assuming a well-mixed water column and a small water depth to width ratio, where a vertical integration results in depth-averaged equations. These require boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the water column, which are provided by the wind stress and the Manning-Chezy formula, respectively:\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see how the initially circular dam with a flat top is now expanding across the domain. The results at the end of the simulation show that the water depth is propagating radially outward, creating complex flow patterns as it moves through the domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analytically, the water depth distribution should be symmetrical, but given our configuration to speed up the simulation, a relatively coarse grid was used. The observed asymmetries and small oscillations in the water depth are numerical artifacts resulting from this discretization. Using a finer grid resolution and smaller time steps would result in a more well-defined and symmetrical water depth distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-section plots reveal important hydraulic features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The initial abrupt step in water depth (between 1m and 11m) has evolved into a smoother profile\n",
    "2. Water is propagating outward as a wave front, with the highest elevation still near the center\n",
    "3. Small oscillations in the water depth profile are characteristic of the second-order numerical scheme implemented in RiverFlowDynamics, which captures wave propagation with higher accuracy but can introduce these artifacts at sharp transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation demonstrates the capability of the RiverFlowDynamics component to capture complex hydraulic phenomena such as dam breaks, flood waves, and their propagation over time."

    "This simulation demonstrates the classical dam break problem in a circular configuration. Initially, we have a higher water level inside a circular boundary (the \"dam\"), with a lower water level outside. When the simulation begins, the dam is instantly removed, allowing water to flow outward in all directions due to the pressure gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key phenomena observed in this simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Wave propagation**: As the dam breaks, a wave front propagates outward from the center.\n",
    "2. **Momentum conservation**: The water carries momentum as it flows, creating complex flow patterns.\n",
    "3. **Mass conservation**: The total volume of water in the system remains constant.\n",
    "4. **Friction effects**: Manning's coefficient accounts for the frictional losses as water flows over the surface.\n",
